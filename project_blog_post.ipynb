You can report things like accuracies on train/test data, loss scores, comparisons to previous models, etc. To compare a small set of numbers, tables are fine, but more complex phenomena should be illustrated with figures. Both figures and tables should include appropriate captions, axis labels, legends, and another professional annotations. It’s fine for your figures to either be constructed manually or as computational outputs (e.g. from Pandas).\n",
